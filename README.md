# MACD Based Trading Strat
Hi! I'm Advait.
Welcome to my repository.
I'm an IT engineer with a zest for Quantitative Analysis, Algorithmic Trading, and Statistics.
I've created this repo to host some of the mini-projects I've completed while exploring this domain.
In this mini-project, I've explored the use of Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) crossovers as a strategy for generating trading signals.
MACD is a momentum-driven trend indicator which makes use of exponential moving averages in order to identify price action trends and harness them to generate profitable trading signals.
Enjoy!
