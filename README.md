# MACD Based Trading Strat
In this mini-project, I've explored the use of Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) crossovers as a strategy for generating trading signals.
MACD is a momentum-driven trend indicator which makes use of exponential moving averages in order to identify price action trends and harness them to generate profitable trading signals.
Enjoy!
